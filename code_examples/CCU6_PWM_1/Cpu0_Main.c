 /*\name Generation of PWM via CCU6
 * \brief Three center aligned pulse width modulated (PWM) signals with fixed frequency and different duty-cycles are generated using CCU6.
 * \description The code example uses the Timer 12 of CCU6 and its three compare modules generate three PWM signals with frequency 20 kHz and different duty-cycles (respectively 25%, 50% and 75%).
 *              T12 is configured to count up and down and the three signals are center aligned.
 *              The generated PWM signals are sent to the pins available to the board, and can be observed with an oscilloscope.
 *
 * \identifier CCU6_PWM_1
 * \version V1.0.0
 * \board APPLICATION KIT TC2X7 V1.1, KIT_AURIX_TC297_TFT_BC-Step, TC29xTA/TX_BC-step
